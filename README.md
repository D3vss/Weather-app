# Weather App: A simple web app that displays weather

# Description: 
The project is very simple. I decided to work on it when I was learning about APIs and how they work. I have learned a lot about calling APIs and manipulating RAW data.

# How to use:
The UI is very intuitive, you simply enter the name of the city and the result is displayed. If the name of the city is wrong, a warning message is displayed. 

# How does it work: 
The API I'm calling is from **[OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)** (I recommend it if you are a beginner with APIs). I created a function with plain JS that calls the API and gets the JSON data file. Then I manipulated the data according to my needs (because they provide a lot of information).
